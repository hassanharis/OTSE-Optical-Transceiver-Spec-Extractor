"""Remove duplicate runs from the run store.

Duplicates were found by SHA-256 of content.md: identical parsed text means the
same PDF was processed twice. `source_file` in meta.json is a Streamlit temp path
and cannot be used for this.

Two dispositions:

DELETE  — the run carries nothing the surviving run does not. Incomplete pipelines
          and strictly worse extractions of the same PDF.
ARCHIVE — the run is a duplicate for corpus-counting purposes, so it must leave
          runs/, but it records a measurement that cannot be reconstructed from
          what remains. Moved to runs_archive/.

Run IDs referenced by Eval/gold/gold_routing.csv are refused outright: deleting
one silently drops rows from the gold set.

Usage:
    python cleanup_runs.py --dry-run
    python cleanup_runs.py
