## **QSFP28 100G COHERENT DWDM SFF-8636** QSFP28, 100GBASE-ZR Coh 50/100GHz Tunable 80km, 22dB, SFF, LC 

## TQ2028-TUNC-SO 

The TQ2028-TUNC-SO is a pluggable QSFP28 DWDM transceiver designed for high capacity 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100GbE) Data Center Interconnect (DCI) optical communication applications up to 80km over a singlemode fiber. 

The transceiver utilizes a tunable DP-QPSK modulated 28 Gbps wavelength with ability to be tuned with either 50GHz or 100GHz spacing enabling up to 96 channels over a 50GHz DWDM grid system as specified in the ITU-T 694.1 standard. The media side is encoded with Staircase FEC (SC-FEC). 

The electrical signals are transmitted and received from the host via a standard 38 pin connector described in the QSFP28 MSA (SFF-8679). The electrical interface is compliant to CAUI-4 (IEEE P802.3bm Annex 83E), splitting the 100Gbps signal in to four parallel 25 Gbps NRZ streams. 

The management interface specification of the module is compliant to SFF-8636. For CMIS compliant version, see p/n: TQ2025TUNx-SO.
