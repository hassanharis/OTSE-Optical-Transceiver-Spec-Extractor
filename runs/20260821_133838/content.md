**Figure 1. Transceiver Block Diagram** 

## **Transmitter** 

The optical transmitter portion of the transceiver (see Figure 1) incorporates a 4-channel VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) array, a 4-channel input buffer and laser driver, diagnostic monitors, control and bias blocks. The transmitter is designed for IEC-60825 and CDRH eye safety compliance; Class 1M out of the module.  The Tx Input Buffer provides CML compatible differential inputs presenting a nominal differential input impedance of 100 Ohms.  AC coupling capacitors are located inside the QSFP module and are not required on the host board.  For module control and interrogation, the control interface (LVTTL compatible) incorporates a Two Wire Serial (TWS) interface of clock and data signals.  Diagnostic monitors for VCSEL bias, light output (LOP), temperature, and power supply voltage are implemented and results are available through the TWS interface. 

Alarm thresholds are established for the monitored attributes.  Flags are set and interrupts generated when the attributes are outside the thresholds.  Flags are also set and interrupts generated for loss of input signal (LOS) and transmitter fault conditions.  All flags are latched and will remain set even if the condition initiating the latch clears and operation resumes.  All interrupts can be masked and flags are reset by reading the appropriate flag register. The optical output will squelch for loss of input signal unless squelch is disabled.  Fault detection or channel deactivation through the TWS interface will disable the channel.  Status, alarm and fault information are available via the TWS interface.  To reduce the need for polling, the hardware interrupt signal is provided to inform hosts of an assertion of an alarm, LOS and/or Tx fault. 

## **Receiver** 

The optical receiver portion of the transceiver (see Figure 1) incorporates a 4-channel PIN photodiode array, a 4-channel TIA array, a 4 channel output buffer, diagnostic monitors, control and bias blocks.  The Rx Output Buffer provides CML compatible differential outputs for the high speed electrical interface presenting nominal single-ended output impedances of 50 Ohms to AC ground and 100 Ohms differentially that should be differentially terminated with 100 Ohms.  AC coupling capacitors are located inside the QSFP module and are not required on the host board.  Diagnostic monitors for optical input power, are implemented and results are available through the TWS interface. 

Alarm thresholds are established for the monitored attributes. Flags are set and interrupts generated when the attributes are outside the thresholds. Flags are also set and interrupts generated for loss of optical input signal (LOS). All flags are latched and will remain set even if the condition initiating the latch clears and operation resumes. All interrupts can be masked and flags are reset upon reading the appropriate flag register. The electrical output will squelch for loss of input signal (unless squelch is disabled) and channel de-activation through TWS interface. Status and alarm information are available via the TWS interface. To reduce the need for polling, the hardware interrupt signal is provided to inform hosts of an assertion of an alarm and/or LOS. 

## **High Speed Signal Interface** 

Figure 2 shows the interface between an ASIC/SerDes and the QSFP module. For simplicity, only one channel is shown.  As shown in the Figure 2, the compliance points are on the host board side of the electrical connectors. Unused inputs and outputs should be terminated with 100 Ω differential loads.

## **Control Signal Interface** 

The module has the following low speed signals for control and status: ModSelL, LP Mode, ResetL, ModPrsL, IntL  In addition, there is an industry standard two wire serial interface scaled for 3.3 volt LVTTL. It is implemented as a slave device. Signal and timing characteristics are further defined in the Control Characteristics and Control Interface & Memory Map sections. The registers of the serial interface memory are defined in the Control Interface & Memory Map section. 

## **Package Outline** 

The module is designed to meet the package outline defined in the QSFP MSA. See the package outline and host board footprint figures (Figures 11 -13) for details. 

## **Handling and Cleaning** 

The transceiver module can be damaged by exposure to current surges and over voltage events. Care should be taken to restrict exposure to the conditions defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings. Wave soldering, reflow soldering and/or aqueous wash process with the modules on board are not recommended. Normal handling precautions for electrostatic discharge sensitive devices should be observed. 

Each module is supplied with an inserted port plug for protection of the optical ports. This plug should always be in place whenever a fiber cable is not inserted. 

The optical connector includes recessed elements that are exposed whenever a cable or port plug is not inserted. Prior to insertion of a fiber optic cable, it is recommended that the cable end be cleaned to avoid contamination from the cable plug. The port plug ensures the optics remain clean and no addition cleaning should be needed. In the event of contamination, dry nitrogen or clean dry air at less than 20 psi can be used to dislodge the contamination.  The optical port features (e.g. guide pins) preclude use of a solid instrument.  Liquids are also not advised. 

## **Link Model and Reference Channel** 

## **Regulatory & Compliance Issues** 

Various standard and regulations apply to the modules. These include eye-safety, EMC, ESD and RoHS.  See the Regulatory Section for details regarding these and component recognition. Please note the transmitter module is a Class 1M laser product – DO NOT VIEW RADIATION DIRECTLY WITH OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS. See Regulatory Compliance Table for details. When released, the AFBR-79Q4Z and AFBR-79Q5Z will support this table. 

Performance specifications for the AFBR-79Q4Z Transceiver are based on a reference channel model. A reference channel model provides the basis for inter-operability between independently produced transceiver modules. The reference model used for the AFBR-79Q4Z Transceiver is based on the industry standard 10GbE link model (10GEPBud3_1_16a.xls available at the IEEE P802.3ae 10Gb/s Ethernet Task Force Serial PMD Documents website: www.ieee802.org/3/ae/public/adhoc/serial_ pmd/documents/)

## **Absolute Maximum Ratings** 

Stress in excess of any of the individual Absolute Maximum Ratings can cause immediate catastrophic damage to the module even if all other parameters are within Recommended Operation Conditions.  It should not be assumed that limiting values of more than one parameter can be applied to the module concurrently.  Exposure to any of the Absolute Maximum Ratings for extended periods can adversely affect reliability.

## **Control Interface & Memory Map** 

The control interface combines dedicated signal lines for ModSelL, LP Mode, ResetL, ModPrsL, IntL with two-wire serial, TWS, interface clock, SCL, and data, SDA, signals to provide users rich functionality over an efficient and easily used interface. The TWS interface is implemented as a slave device and compatible with industry standard two-wire serial protocol. It is scaled for 3.3 volt LVTTL. Outputs are high-z in the high state to support busing of these signals. Signal and timing characteristics are further defined in the Control I/O Characteristics section. In general, TWS bus timing and protocols follow the implementation popularized in Atmel Two-wire Serial EEPROMs. For additional details see, e.g., Atmel AT24C01A. 

## **ModSelL** 

The ModSelL is an inputsignal. When held low by the host, the module responds to 2-wire serial communication commands. The ModSelL allows the use of multiple QSFP modules on a single 2-wire interface bus. When the ModSelL is “High”, the module will not respond to or acknowledge any 2-wire interface communication from the host. ModSelL signal input node is biased to the “High” state in the module. In order to avoid conflicts, the host system shall not attempt 2-wire interface communications within the ModSelL de-assert time after any QSFP modules are deselected. Similarly, the host must wait at least for the period of the ModSelL assert time before communicating with the newly selected module. The assertion and de-asserting periods of different modules may overlap as long as the above timing requirements are met. 

## **ResetL** 

The ResetL signal is pulled to Vcc in the QSFP module. A low level on the ResetL signal for longer than the minimum pulse length (t_Reset_init) initiates a complete module reset, returning all user module settings to their default state. Module Reset Assert Time (t_init) starts on the rising edge after the low level on the ResetL pin is released. During the execution of a reset (t_init) the host shall disregard all status bits until the module inidicates a completion of the reset interrupt. The module indicates this by posting an IntL signal with the Data_Not_Ready bit negated. Note that on power up (including hot insertion) the module will post this completion of reset interrupt without requiring a reset. 

## **LPMode** 

## **ModPrsL** 

ModPrsL is pulled up to Vcc_Host on the host board and grounded in the module. The ModPrsL is asserted “Low” when inserted and deasserted “High” when the module is physically absent from the host connector. 

## **IntL** 

IntL is an output signal. When “Low”, it indicates a possible module operational fault or a status critical to the host system. The host identifies the source of the interrupt using the 2-wire serial interface.The IntL signal is an open collector output and must be pulled to host supply voltage on the host board. 

The user can read the present value of the various diagnostic monitors. For transmitters and receivers, internal module temperature and supply voltages are reported. For transmitters, monitors provide for each channel laser bias current and laser light output power (LOP) information. For receivers, input power (Pave) is monitored for each channel. In addition, elapsed operating time is reported. All monitor items are two-byte fields and to maintain coherency, the host must access these with single two-byte read sequences. For each monitored item, alarm thresholds are established. If an item moves past a threshold, a flag is set, and, provided the item is not masked, IntL is asserted. 

A mask bit that can be set to prevent assertion of IntL for the individual item exists for every LOS, Tx fault and monitor flag. Entries in the mask fields are volatile. 

## **Memory Map Overview** 

The memory is structured as a single address, multiple page approach after that in the XFP MSA. The address is given as A0xh. The structure of the memory is shown in Figure 14. The memory space is arranged into a lower, single page, address space of 128 bytes and multiple upper address space pages. This structure permits timely access to addresses in the lower page, e.g. Interrupt Flags and Monitors. Less time critical entries, e.g. serial ID information and threshold settings, are available with the Page Select function. For a more detailed description of the QSFP memory map see the QSFP MSA specification revision 1.0.
